# Django-POC

At this moment, Django POC (*Proof of Concept*) is a project where we can test some django and django-restframework resource.

Some ideas used here, like design/architecture project, were inspired/copied from [Two Scoops of Django 3.x](https://daniel.roygreenfeld.com/two-scoops-of-django-3-x.html) book!


## Development

This section has some useful tools and strategy to help in
the development process with django and django-restframework.

**Tips**

- For development use django-extensions
- For development use pre-commit hooks to check the code (e.g.: flake8, black, isort, mypy, etc)
- Check if all urls were defined correctly using `python manage.py show_urls`
